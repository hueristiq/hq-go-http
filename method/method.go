package method

// Method represents an HTTP method as defined by IANA.
//
// The Method type is a string alias that encapsulates common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.
// This strong typing improves code clarity and type safety by ensuring only valid HTTP method names are used.
type Method string

// String returns the underlying string representation of the Method.
//
// This method converts the Method (a string alias) to its plain string value. This conversion is
// particularly useful when the method needs to be included in HTTP requests, log messages, or debug output.
//
// Returns:
//   - method (string): The HTTP method as a string.
func (m Method) String() (method string) {
	method = string(m)

	return
}

// Predefined HTTP method constants.
//
// These constants represent the most common HTTP methods and are declared as type Method to ensure
// type safety and to prevent common errors such as misspelling method names. Although some of these
// methods (like POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) may cause changes on the server, they are included
// here to cover a full range of common HTTP operations.
