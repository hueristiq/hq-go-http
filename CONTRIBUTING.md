### Styleguide

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Here are a few points to keep in mind:

* All dependencies must be defined in the `go.mod` file.
	* Advanced IDEs and code editors (like VSCode) will take care of that, but to be sure, run `make go-mod-tidy` to validate dependencies.
* Please run `make go-fmt` before committing to ensure code aligns with go standards.
* We use [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting Go code, run `make go-lint` before submitting PR. Editors such as Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IntelliJ; with Go support plugin will offer `golangci-lint` automatically.
* For details on the approved style, check out [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
